# Valley Catholic Basketball Data Upload

This guide walks you through uploading all the Valley Catholic basketball team data to your database.

## Prerequisites

1. **Supabase Tables Must Exist** - First, ensure you've run the latest SUPABASE_SETUP.sql in your Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Environment Variables** - Your `server/.env` file must have valid Supabase credentials:
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
   ```

## Step 1: Run SUPABASE_SETUP.sql (If Not Done Yet)

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** The teams, players, and games tables must exist first!

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com)
2. Select your project
3. Click **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
4. Click **New Query**
5. Copy the entire contents of `SUPABASE_SETUP.sql`
6. Paste into the editor
7. Click **Run**
8. Wait for confirmation - you should see "Success" with no errors

## Step 2: Run the Seeding Script

From your project root directory:

```bash
cd server
node seed-valley-catholic.js
```

You should see output like:
```

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "SUPABASE_URL is not defined"**
→ Check that `server/.env` exists and has valid credentials

**Error: "relation 'teams' does not exist"**
→ You haven't run SUPABASE_SETUP.sql yet - do that first in Supabase SQL Editor

**Error: "Unauthorized"**
→ Your Supabase credentials are invalid - regenerate anon key in Supabase dashboard

**Script hangs**
→ Check your internet connection and Supabase project status

## Verify Data Upload

After running the seed script:

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com)
2. Select your project
3. Click **Table Editor** (left sidebar)
4. Check these tables have data:
   - `teams` - Should have 2 rows (Valley Catholic Boys, Valley Catholic Girls)
   - `players` - Should have 25 rows total
   - `games` - Should have 50 rows total

## View in App

1. Go to your app at `https://your-domain.com`
2. Click **Teams** button in navbar
3. You should see:

- Game results can be updated via admin panel once feature is built
- All heights are stored as strings for flexibility
- Timestamps (created_at, updated_at) are auto-generated by Supabase
